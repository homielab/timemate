TimeMate is a Pomodoro timer that lives in your menu bar. It helps you focus on your work and remember to take breaks.

## üß© What is TimeMate?

TimeMate is a small, focused application for macOS built around the Pomodoro Technique. It lives entirely in your menu bar, providing a simple way to manage cycles of work and rest without adding clutter to your screen or Dock.

The idea is simple: work in focused sprints (e.g., 25 minutes), then take a short break (5 minutes). After a few cycles, you take a longer break. This rhythm is proven to help maintain concentration and prevent mental fatigue. TimeMate automates this process for you.

## üí° Why I Built It

As a developer, I'm constantly switching between coding, research, and planning. Distractions are everywhere. I needed a tool to enforce focus, but the apps I found were either too complex, too distracting, or too resource-heavy.

I wanted something that would just sit quietly in my menu bar, do its job, and stay out of my way. I couldn't find exactly what I was looking for, so I built TimeMate‚Äîfirst for myself, and now for anyone else who values simplicity and focus.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- **Lives in Your Menu Bar**: Your timer is always a single click away, without ever cluttering your desktop.
- **Simple Pomodoro Workflow**: Automatically cycles through Focus, Short Break, and Long Break sessions.
- **Customizable Durations**: Easily adjust the length of each session to match how you work.
- **Automatic Transitions**: Move from work to break without any manual clicks, keeping you in the flow.
- **Gentle Notifications**: A subtle alert lets you know when a session is over, so you don't have to watch the clock.
- **Clean & Minimal Design**: The interface is built to be functional and unobtrusive. It's a tool, not a distraction.
- **Lightweight & Native**: Built for macOS, it's efficient and uses minimal system resources.
- **Multi-Language**: Supports both English and Vietnamese.

## üöÄ Why Use TimeMate?

- **To Improve Focus**: It provides a clear structure for deep work, helping you ignore distractions and dedicate your attention to a single task.
- **To Avoid Burnout:** The regular, enforced breaks help you rest and recharge, leading to a more sustainable and productive workday.
- **For Simplicity**: There are no unnecessary features. TimeMate is built to do one thing and do it well. It‚Äôs a simple solution for a common problem.
